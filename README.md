## About

This is a variant of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe (AKA Noughts and Crosses) built with React and Bootstrap. It features a rich, mobile-friendly user interface, a decent AI to play against (thanks to jatin-47 for the minimax algorithm code), game history tracking, multiple grid sizes and many settings!

The game tracks your matches through a stats modal. It shows your wins, losses, draws and even the times you cheated (because you pressed the history buttons). The settings let you change various things - like the theme of the app with dark mode, or the difficulty, the game colors, and more.

It was fun/frustrating to make, since I'd never used React or Bootstrap before (not to mention never having made a version of Tic-Tac-Toe), nor have I used Node or npm, either. It was rewarding in the end, though, as I made a pretty functionally decent web app. Enjoy!
